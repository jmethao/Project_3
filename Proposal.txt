Description/outline: The aim of our project is to explore alligator populations, sightings, and human-related incidents like attacks. Using interactive visualizations, we aim to highlight trends in alligator behavior and interactions with humans, helping raise awareness about alligators in the United States.

The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in 
Choropleth map of Alligator populations within the USA 1900- present
Heatmap or barchart of alligator sightings in the United States
Alligator fatal human attacks in the span of the last 10 years (charts) - line chart
The questions you’ll ask of the data
How have the alligator population changed over the years? Are there any population trends that we are seeing with alligators in the United States? - James
Has alligator sightings decreased or increased over time? Do we see an increase in a certain season (or months) compared to others? - Mai
Is there an increase of alligator attacks over time? Where in the United States are the alligator attacks or human-related incidents occurring most frequently? - Mee
Does the weather affect the alligator’s behavior? Such as attacking humans more? Showing certain odd behaviors not seen often? -Susan
